xeno,Of course your in the “fence jumpers side”! Pennsylvanians AMERICANS HAVE THE LAST WORD. t.co/bB1d4nTST6
xeno,Just on the border lies. The fence jumpers are going through a water pipe in California. The broken down wall scam has cost millions and was ILLEGALLY contracted. Go figure. How many of the trump boys got arrested for the stolen funds? It is endless bullshit.
xeno,"hows your intellect on eastern Europeans. We all came LEGALLY into this country. Not paying for fence jumpers, tunnel crawlers or trailer hiders. t.co/pMNl0fqjCY"
xeno,So you justify legal immigration by boarder crossers. New flash there are more countries in this world besides Latin Americans. They are coming in this COUNTRY as LEGAL immigrants! 
xeno,"I am South African, I love my country, and I hate border fence jumpers with all my heart.☹"
xeno,You want a REAL threat to democracy.  Four fence jumpers at white house and media laughed.  90 secret service agents injured some with bricks to their heads and media and biden called them peaceful protestors.  Secret service vehicles were destroyed.  Media will destroy america
xeno,ILLEGAL FENCE JUMPERS made the choice to break the law .BYE.

xeno,"Bunch of ungrateful fence jumpers, they should all be  send to Moslem country so they eat what they want"
xeno,"Maybe the criminals they engage to smuggle them here illegally should be telling them that we’re culturally opposed to halal certification before they hand over their money. 

Crazy plan no doubt but it just might work! Thumbs up"
xeno,No the GOP has a lot of fence jumpers coming in
xeno,"easy answer,
Europeans came here legally, through ports of entry, they respected our country and worked hard to support their families.

fence jumpers came here illegally, they don’t give a shit about our country and just want everything for free."
xeno," I wait for the day you aliens will start having nore oppinions about your own Country Zimbabwe, your nonsense of acting clever while you're border jumpers is irritating"
xeno,It will be conservatives that don't follow Trudeau's path to socialist communism. It won't be for refugees or border jumpers - he welcomes them with arms wide open and instant citizenship.

-give them health care @ $10,000 ea
-plus add 4 tril in tax increase from Climate change & Foreign Plans"
xeno,"It's like when stopping illegal immigration or at least slowing it is translates into Trump hates immigrants. No, he dislikes law-breaking fence jumpers who are actually jumping in line of others who are waiting to enter the U.S."
xeno,"Will he finally deport all these illegal immigrants? ALL of them! My wife is from overseas, and to bring her into the US  legally, cost me 3 years & over 10,000.00 USD! Why should these border jumpers be given special consideration? What happened to the law?"
xeno,"America is a hellhole already. We need to deport those who never should've been here in the first place, and ban ALL 3rd world immigration permanently."

xeno,"Those burder jumpers are rapists, predators and dangerous people!"
xeno,"FACT.....Foreigners are less of a hassle, especially when it comes to labour issues. Last time I checked, there are more South Africans incarcerated than border jumpers. Use your paintbrush sparingly, it's tainting innocent people and fueling nonsense"

xeno,"That is 60K they know about. Estimates put illegals at upwards of 800K. They include clandestine entry, failed asylum seekers who don’t leave & overstayed visas. The cost to the NHS & welfare system could run into £billions. See http://migrationwatch.uk.org as a source example"
xeno,"Not surprised , while they’ve been housing them in four-star hotels, and that’s got around the world to migrants wanting to come here."
xeno,What`s the word for masses of people illegally entering a country for no good reason other than to pillage the resources again? Asking for a friend..
xeno,Our system for dealing with irregular immigration is blatantly unfit for purpose.We need a clear out of existing management and a new generation of immigration judges.
xeno,"Absolutely disgusting, send them home, we are not able to house our own."
xeno,For now.  Give it a few years.  They’ll build houses to house the vast numbers of migrants coming in and hey voila! The beautiful countryside will be gone.  I hate Britain now.  I feel like I live in a foreign country.
xeno,"Why you hate Trump so much? Lol Cus he says mean things? The guy brought our economy back from brink of recession, stands up to China, building the border wall so we don’t get flooded with migrants, created Space Force, and doesn’t wish to defund police, what more do you want?"
xeno,"Why should we like migrants ? Look at their actions every single day ! I don't like migrants who rape girls and women, use violence, fight the police, attack our values ​​and norms, take advantage of our social security, who hate gays and lesbians. THESE are reasons to be worried"

xeno, Does anyone do health checks on all your illegal immigrants who are swarming into your country? Send them back for their own protection!
xeno,"Nope. Its called jail. We didn't go to war with south America like we did with japan. 
South Americans are just coming in droves illegally so we put them in jail then send them back."
xeno,Good use of the word citizen as we need to lock up all the illegals and questionable status individuals and send them back to their country of origin. #Excelsior
xeno,"Then, they can act fast to stop accepting illegal immigrants. They can make decrees to be able to send them back. Very funny how they can make some laws and not others."
xeno,"Exactly 
@pritipatel
 why aren't laws changed in regard to illegal immigrants at such speed? What exactly is your agenda?"

xeno,"Why are illegal aliens here to begin with and why are tax payers funding their medical services. Send them back faster , so we can avoide all this mess or better stop them before they get here."
xeno,"It's good that ice in America is so lenient and merciful to simply send them back where they belong. If this were a dictatorship, they would just disappear along with anybody who fought for illegal aliens to stay within our border."
xeno,Isnt ICE’s job to round up these illegal aliens and send them back to where they cane from? Congress created ICE. You Omar must abide by what your colleagues 
xeno,no we don’t want them. send them back to Ching Chong land
xeno,"Lol, you’ll say anything to keep illegal aliens here! If they don’t have a temperature, send them back! If they have a temperature, lock them up until they don’t, then send them back."
xeno,"If they are in the US illegally then send them back. Its past time to start following our laws!!! Sorry, 
@Ilhan

xeno,"This may be a dumb question, but why are dozens of Somalians here illegally? Detain (jail) them if they are so concerned with Covid-19. Then deport."
xeno,No we only put illegal aliens in cages. We should just send them back to where they came from immediately.
xeno,Need to remove them and send them back to meddle in their own failed countries! 
xeno,Not only that I don't want to get free insurance to illegal aliens I don't want to give them one dime of federal money not one dime no free education no nothing send them back to their countries and fill out the papers to come here legally and then maybe you can enjoy the USA!
xeno,Yeah. Tired of illegal aliens. Send them back.
xeno,"Sure, but that doesn’t cover the illegal aliens flooding on to our shores, lapping up taxpayers money in luxury hotels, as we prepare to send them back to mainland Europe where they were perfectly safe."
xeno,"Britain would be British if it actually closed its borders as Britain has lost its identity now. Women cannot go out on their own as they are surrounded by immigrants/refugees with possible criminal records but nobody knows anything about them! CARE ABOUT BRITISH, NOT OTHERS!"
